# Lebesgue measure on `ℂ`

In this file we define Lebesgue measure on `ℂ`. Since `ℂ` is defined as a `structure` as the
push-forward of the volume on `ℝ²` under the natural isomorphism. There are (at least) two
frequently used ways to represent `ℝ²` in `mathlib`: `ℝ × ℝ` and `Fin 2 → ℝ`. We define measurable
equivalences (`MeasurableEquiv`) to both types and prove that both of them are volume preserving
(in the sense of `MeasureTheory.measurePreserving`).
