# In-progress experimentation for rendering LaTeX

This branch is for experimentation only.

We've got two ways to render math available to us:
- MathJax
- KaTeX

We put the local copies of MathJax and KaTeX at the top level. (This is not how we'd want to actually do things! Quick access for demo purposes only.)

#mkrpcenc TextProps

structure TeXProps extends TextProps where
  display : Bool := false
#mkrpcenc TeXProps


/- # MathJax

We switch between MathJax for SVG and MathJax for CHTML for demo purposes. That means you may need to "click to reload" at certain pointsâ€”a misclick can get the webview stuck in an errored state if it tries to e.g. find a function that doesn't exist on the current MathJax object.

We use the whole MathJax *source* directory, in case we want to try to modify it to get fonts to work.

The `mathjax/` directory here was obtained with
```
# clone source; would otherwise use https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax.git
git clone https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src.git mathjax

# build
cd mathjax
npm install
npm run compile
npm run make-components
cd ..
```
