# In-progress experimentation for rendering LaTeX

This branch is for experimentation only.

We've got two ways to render math available to us:
- MathJax
- KaTeX

We put the local copies of MathJax and KaTeX at the top level. (This is not how we'd want to actually do things! Quick access for demo purposes only.)
